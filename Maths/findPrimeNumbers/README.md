Prime Number Generator
-----

*Language*: [Python (version 3)](http://docs.python.org/3/)

*Description*: The code shows a list of prime numbers from 2 through 97, using a sieve algorithm. 

*Addtional Study points*: 
* How could you change the code to calculate larger prime numbers?
* It looks at only odd numbers. Why?
* It starts at integer 2. Why? 
* What is a sieve algorithm?
* The program will run faster using int(n**0.5) rather than using math.sqrt(n)

*Further Study*:
The official definition for a [prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) is any natural number greater than 1 that has the two divisors 1 and itself. 
So, we are leaving the 1 out!
This is not a generator object in the Python sense. 
This is certainly _not_ the best way to get prime numbers using the Python programming language.
