### Challenge students through bulletin board posts using code.

Computer code bulletin board posts to inspire self-motivated learning in primary and secondary school. 

> These posts are meant to be _hard_ for those who are not familiar with code, computer science, or computational thinking. 
> They are meant for self-directed or peer based learning. An example:


__Q.__ What color is represented by: #00FF00

> This question requires knowledge of HEX representation of the RGB color coding scheme and the ability to seek out a web page or program which will display the HEX code as a graphic color swatch. 
> Remember that all of these concepts were, at one point, new to you. 
> 
> The posts are meant to be straightforward and intuitive for those who put in the work. 
> The work in this context can be as simple as taking the time to type the program into an editor. 
> This is a big enough challange for those who are unfamiliar with computers, typing, a code editor, or even how to navigate the file system. 
> Beginners will tend to type code into a word processing program and expect the computer to know what to do with the file when accessed.


__E.__ Presenting the challenge:

> We've found the best format for presenting the challenge is to print them and post in a public space; a bulletin board.
> Provide a submission box for answers. Allow a student to revise their answer once before the cut-off. 
> Remember learning from their peers is learning; and a critical skill in todayâ€™s information saturated world.


__D.__ All posts should fit on a single 8x11 or A4 sheet.

> We suggest, with a bit of irony, that the presentation of the challenge be on paper. 
> A single piece of paper posted on a bulletin board or other public space. 
> The computer provides too much temptation to copy &amp; paste posts into search engines.
> The in-person group analysis provides an opportunity for both discussion and peer collaboration. 
> Reward predictors create an energetic, pleasant feeling that motivates behavior for reward pursuit.
