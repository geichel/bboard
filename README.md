Weekly CS quizzes to inspire self-motivated learning in primary and secondary school. 

These questions are meant to be _hard_ for those who are not familiar with code, computer science, or computational thinking. 
They are meant for self-directed or peer based learning. An example:


Q. What color is represented by: #00FF00

This question requires knowledge of HEX representation of the RGB color coding scheme and the ability to seek out a web page or program which will display the HEX code as a graphic color swatch. 
Remember that all of these concepts were at one point new to you. 

The questions are meant to be straightforward and intuitive for those who put in the work. 
The work in this context can be as simple as taking the time to type the program into an editor. 
This is a big enough challange for those who are unfamiliar with computers, typing, a code editor, or even how to navigate the file system. 
Beginners will tend to type code into a word processing program and expect the computer to know what to do with the file when accessed.


E. Presenting the challenge:

We've found the best format for presenting the challenge is to print them and post in a public space; a bulletin board.
Provide a submission box for answers. Allow a student to revise their answer once before the cut-off. 
Remember learning from their peers is learning; and a critical skill in today’s information saturated world.


D. All questions should fit on a single 8x11 or A4 sheet.

We suggest, with a bit of irony, that the presentation of the challenge be on paper. 
The computer provides too much temptation to copy &amp; paste questions into search engines and provides an opportunity for frictionless peer to peer “collaboration”.
